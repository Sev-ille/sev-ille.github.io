            <br>
            <p id = 'style'>I'm curently re-reading the <i>Six of Crows</i> duology, which is one of my favorite book series and universes. <wbr>It is also written by one of my faroite authors, <b>Leigh Bardugo</b>. I'm also reading Farenheight 451 for my English class.</p>

            <h3>Baking</h3>
            <br>
            <p id = 'style'>I find it really calming and theraputic to bake. One of my favorite things to make are pies. I make everything <wbr>from the filling to the crust from scratch. I really started when my dad developed an allergy to gluten, so most things I make are gluten free.</p>

            <h3>Rowing</h3>
            <p id = 'style'>Rowing is what I spend a magority of my free time on, and I can't really call it a hobby, but I spend so much time on it I have little time for anything else. <span style = "font-style: italic; color: rgb(109, 109, 109);">I'm at my dock 6 days a week for 2-2.5 hours every day. I get home at 7:30 everyday, so I don't have time for other hobbies.</span></p>
